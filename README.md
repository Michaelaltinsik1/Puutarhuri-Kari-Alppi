# Puutarhuri Kari Alppi

A frontend project were I use Next.js, TypeScript and Styled components. I created this project based on a request from a relative. I initially set up a design file on figma with a first draft on the project and asked for feedback. Once I had a design that was accepted, I started thinking about what technologies to use. I ended up using Next.js with TypeScript, Styled components and started coding the project.

In this project I also integrated Nodemailer to send email when the contact form is submitted. I also used Google's Recaptcha v3 to increase security and reduce fraud, bots and other automated attacks. Also the contact form be submitable if the recaptcha determines the user being malicious.
